# IndicTrans Workshop 2022

In this workshop, we will finetune [wav2vec2]() style model from scratch on custom asr data using [Fairseq]() library. We will also train an n-gram language model using [Kenlm]() library. Finally we will export it to Huggingface's format and deploy it as a web app using [Gradio](). 
The resources provided in this workshop will help you to understand 
- How to run inference with IndicTrans model
- How to use the model with hosted APIs
- How to use `fairseq` to run inference
- How to fine-tune IndicTrans with your custom dataset

IndicTrans poster can be found [here](https://github.com/AI4Bharat/indicTrans/blob/main/AI4B_Demo/IndicTrans%20Poster.pdf)

You can use GitHub discussions for any questions realted to the model usage or any general feedback
